<h2>Introduction to IOStreams in Java</h2>
<h3>What are IOStreams?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>IOStreams provide an efficient way to handle input and output operations in Java.</li>
  <li>They are used to read from and write to different types of data sources, such as files, network connections, and memory.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Types of IOStreams</h3>
    <ul>
  <li>Java IOStreams are classified into two types:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Byte Streams: Used for handling raw binary data.</li>
    <li>Character Streams: Used for handling character-based data, such as text.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
   
   <h3>Byte Streams</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Byte Streams read and write data as individual bytes.</li>
      <li>Example byte stream classes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>InputStream: Used to read bytes from a data source.</li>
         <li>OutputStream: Used to write bytes to a data destination.</li>
      </ul>
       </ul>
    <h3>Character Streams<h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Character Streams read and write data as characters.</li>
     <li>Example character stream classes:</li>
     <ul>
       <li>Reader: Used to read characters from a data source.</li>
       <li>Writer: Used to write characters to a data destination.</li>
     </ul>
  </ul>
