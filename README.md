<h2>Introduction to IOStreams in Java</h2>
<h3>What are IOStreams?</h3>
<h3>Types of IOStreams</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java IOStreams are classified into two types:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Byte Streams: Used for handling raw binary data.</li>
    <li>Character Streams: Used for handling character-based data, such as text.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>What are Object Streams?</h3>
   <h3>What are Standard IO streams?</h3>
  
 <h3>IOStream Classes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>FileInputStream: Reads bytes from a file.</li>
    <li>FileOutputStream: Writes bytes to a file.</li>
    <li>FileReader: Reads characters from a file.</li>
    <li>FileWriter: Writes characters to a file.</li>
    <li>BufferedReader: Efficiently reads characters from a Reader.</li>
    <li>BufferedWriter: Efficiently writes characters to a Writer.</li>
     </ul>

  <h3>What is Serilzation and Deserilzation?</h3>
  <h4>Steps to remember while doing Serilzation</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>For is a relation :if Parent class implements serilizable interface child class also serilzable implcitly</li>
  <li>Has relation:Both main and dependent class must implements serilizable interface.Then only we can achieve Serilzation</li>
  <li>Cannot Serilize static varible</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent Singleton class rule violation from the serlization Serilization</h3>
<h3>Customize Serilzation?</h3>
 <h4>By the Externalization we can achive custom Serilzation</h4>
